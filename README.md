# Tetromino Puzzle: Assembling the Perfect Square

## Project Overview

This project involves developing a program that tackles a captivating spatial challenge: assembling tetrominoes to form the smallest possible square. Get ready to test your problem-solving skills and algorithm design!

## Key Components:

- File Handling:
    - Reads the tetromino data from the specified text file.
    - Validates the file format and handles potential errors gracefully.
- Tetromino Representation:
    - Stores tetromino shapes in a suitable data structure, such as 2D arrays or matrices.
    - Implements functions to rotate and manipulate tetrominoes as needed.
- Square Assembly Algorithm:
    - Considers backtracking approaches.
- Output Visualization:
    - Renders the final square visually in the console or potentially in a graphical format.

## Usage:

1. Compile the Program: Follow the instructions provided to build the executable.
2. Run the Program: Execute it, passing the path to the tetromino file as an argument:

```
go run . <text_file_path>
```
